## Basic Questions

#### 1.What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

#### How do you declare a variable in JavaScript?

You can declare a variable using the var, let, or const keywords.

var is function-scoped and can be redeclared and updated.
let is block-scoped and can be updated but not redeclared.
const is block-scoped and cannot be updated or redeclared.
```javascript
var x = 5;

```
